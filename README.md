# MongoDB CDC Stream 

## About Mongo CDC
* CDC Stream is a feature of Mongo ReplicaSet
* The MongoDB should run in replica mode (even if it's single instance) for the CDC to work.
* The MongoDB writes all operations to oplog, and streams it from there.
* You can resume the stream from last consumed event using `resume_after` field. See `main.py` for example
* If the oplog expires due to space exhaustion or high write rate, then resume after don't work
* Below is an example from local
```bash
myReplicaSet [direct: primary] test> rs.printReplicationInfo()
